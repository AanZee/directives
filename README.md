# Aan Zee - Directives
A whole bunch of Angular directives made by Aan Zee.
The main purpose of this repository is to create standard directives which we use in numerous projects.

*Version: 0.1.0*

### Usage
1. Include the `dist/js/directives.min.js` in your HTML page after you have declared Angular and copy `dist/views` to a location you prefer.
2. Alter some additional configuration as shown in the example html files.
3. Now you are ready to use our directives in your project. 

**Be aware! There is no CSS included with these directives, only the HTML and Javascript.**

*See the `examples/` folder for example usages of the directives*
